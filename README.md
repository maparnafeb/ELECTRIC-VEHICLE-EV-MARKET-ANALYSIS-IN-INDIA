# EV and Financial Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes financial expenditure data and electric vehicle (EV) sales data in India. It provides insights into income distribution, spending habits, potential savings, and EV adoption trends across states. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering techniques, and recommendations for financial planning and EV market growth.

## Data Sources
### Financial Dataset:
- Contains details on income, rent, insurance, groceries, transportation, and savings.
- Includes disposable income and potential savings across various categories.

### EV Dataset:
- Records sales of electric vehicles across different states and time periods.
- Categorizes vehicles by class, type, and category.

## Key Findings

- Consumers with higher disposable income are more likely to adopt EVs.
- Tier 1 professionals and self-employed individuals are strong potential buyers.
- Middle-income groups may need low-interest EV loans and EMI plans.
- Lower-income consumers require subsidies and financial incentives.

### EV Adoption Trends
